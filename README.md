# BCSHacks-backend
  
### This is the backend version of the website me and my team had built for the BCS Hacks 2022 hackathon.   
  
## Issues:  
### Other than the styles for the home page, everything is working perfectly.  
### The only issue is that the stylesheet for the main page (index.ejs) is not getting applied and even after searching through StackOverflow, I wasn't able to figure it out.

### The server has been created using the Express.js framework in a Node.js environment.
